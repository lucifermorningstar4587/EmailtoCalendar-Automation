# 🚧 Limitations and 🔮 Future Scope

This section outlines the current limitations of the **Email-to-Calendar Automation** prototype and possible improvements that can be made in the future.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- This project is a **prototype** and is demonstrated using a limited dataset.
- Email scanning is performed based on a **manually specified input date** rather than continuous real-time monitoring.
- Deadline extraction is based on **simple keyword or pattern matching**, which may not work for all email formats.
- The automation currently focuses only on emails sent by the **Training and Placement Cell (TPC)**.
- Manual configuration is required during the initial setup in MobileRun.
- The system depends on mobile-based execution using **DroidRun**, which may limit scalability.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Implement **real-time email monitoring** instead of date-based scanning.
- Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to improve accuracy of deadline extraction.
- Support **multiple email accounts** and multiple sender IDs.
- Add a **web-based dashboard** to view and manage all extracted deadlines.
- Enable **cloud-based execution** to remove dependency on a mobile device.
- Allow **custom reminder settings** instead of a fixed 30-minute alert.
- Extend support to other notification sources such as messaging apps or portals.

## 📌 Conclusion

Despite its limitations, this prototype demonstrates how automation can significantly reduce missed deadlines by converting important emails into actionable calendar reminders. With further enhancements, this system can be scaled into a robust real-world solution.
